# React Blot

Just a quick touch blot higher order component, implemented with react-transition-group v2.

My main purpose was to improve on the maths of react-toolbox Ripple component. Rather than a random spread, i'm using basic geometry to calculate the required blot radius to cover the entire container.

### Todo

- Comment your code
- React Transition Group doesn't offer usable transition callbacks.
